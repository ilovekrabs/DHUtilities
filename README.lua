--Hello! My name is Isaac aka rizz god#5961 on discord,
--I am very glad that you chose to use my DH Utilities script.

--Here's a quick tutorial on how to setup the DH Utilities script.


--Load it up:

local DHUtils = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilovekrabs/DHUtilities/madebyrizzgod5961/DHUtilitiesMain'))()

-- go ahead and do this aswell, it's just so i can give myself some credit lols

local DHUtilsHolder = DHUtils.MadeByrizzgod5961() -- name this local whatever you want, example: local sussy = DHUtils.MadeByrizzgod5961()

--now here comes the fun part!
--You can choose from lots of very useful Utilities, such as = {
  DHUtilsHolder.BypassAnticheat(), --pretty much self explanatory by the functions name, but if you still dont know what this does, it bypasses the anticheat
  DHUtilsHolder.Spoof( --if you want every spoof then either put true on all or just dont put anything. example: DHUtilsHolder.Spoof()
    amongus, -- CHECKER_1 --if yes then true if no then false, if something other than true or false is put in function it would just count it as nil
    slay, -- TeleportDetect --if yes then true if no then false, if something other than true or false is put in function it would just count it as nil
    ayosussyuwu -- OneMoreTime --if yes then true if no then false, if something other than true or false is put in function it would just count it as nil
  ),
  DHUtilsHolder.Godmode(godmodetype) -- replace godmode type with one of the godmode types shown here: "Anti-Bullet", there's sadly only 1 godmode for now, please include the strings aka the "" ;P
}

--thats it for now, hope i cya later, have a good morning day evening or night, baiiiii!
